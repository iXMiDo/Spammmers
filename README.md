# TLS-Failure Checker

This tool decrypt only the weak TLS securities to : 

1 - Network Diagnostics: Bypassing TLS might be necessary to diagnose network issues, troubleshoot problems, or monitor traffic.
2 - Security Research: Ethical hackers and security researchers might use TLS bypass techniques to identify vulnerabilities in systems and applications. 

Solving These Cases 

1 - Data Interception: A malicious actor could use TLS bypass to intercept sensitive data being transmitted between parties. This is a significant concern as TLS encryption is designed to protect against eavesdropping.
2 - Malware Distribution: Attackers could use TLS bypass to distribute malware, as they could intercept and modify legitimate software updates or downloads. 
3 - Credential Theft: Bypassing TLS might be used to capture login credentials, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
4 - Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MitM): An attacker could position themselves between the communicating parties, intercepting and potentially altering the data being transmitted.
